# ab-testing-managerial-dominance
A/B test analyzing how relational expectations influence leaders’ likelihood of choosing a more dominant communication option.

# Overview

This repository contains the experimental design and analysis for a randomized A/B test examining how expected relationship impact of dominance (positive vs. negative) influences leaders' choice of a dominant communication option. This study is part a broader project on the unique role of relationship expectancies in how managers' competitive worldview impacts their dominant behavior at work. Here, I show that relationship expectancies not only explain the effect correlationally, but also lead to more dominant behavior experimentally.

# Experimental design

Online participants (N = 492) were instructed to act as managers in a mid-sized company. They were told they needed to assign a challenging task to an employee—another participant on the platform—whose performance would determine the manager’s bonus (up to $1 in addition to a base pay of $1.60). Importantly, the manager had power over the employee in that they determined their bonus (up to $1 as well).

Before choosing how to communicate about the task, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:

  1. Positive Relationship Impact Condition: Participants reflected on how the employee might react **positively** to a dominant message.
  2. Negative Relationship Impact Condition: Participants reflected on how the employee might react **negatively** to a dominant message.

All participants were then shown two possible messages they could send to the employee:

  1. a dominant communication option, and
  2. a non-dominant communication option.

The primary dependent variable was which message they chose to send (0 = non-dominant, 1 = dominant).

This design allows for a clear estimate of how relational expectations shape leaders’ communication decisions.

# Why this matters

Organizations often need to understand how expectations, framing, and communication context influence leaders’ behavior. This repository illustrates how to analyze experimental data in a managerial decision-making scenario, using standard A/B testing methods and a binary behavioral outcome.
